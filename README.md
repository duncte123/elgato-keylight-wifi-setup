# Keylight wifi connection tool

Elgato's android app for control center is garbo, support says my keylight is broken.
My keylight is currently connected to wifi, so take that I guess?

# Future goals
Turn this into a CLI app so linux users can connect their elgato stuff to wifi. (and have some cool bonjour automations along with that)
